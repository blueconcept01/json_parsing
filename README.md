# json_parsing

To run:
python flatten_run.py file_name.json

Restaurant data is already created so delete that data if you want to reparse it otherwise it will be replaced.

Import Notes:
Please note I added date field to restaurant_grade_score.
For the test suite, I had issues with unicode or something.
